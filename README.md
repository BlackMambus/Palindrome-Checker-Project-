# Palindrome-Checker-Project-

palindrome checker in C++ is a program that determines whether a given string or number reads the same forward and backward.
The core idea is to compare characters from the beginning and end, moving toward the center.

How It Works
Input Handling: The user provides a string or number.

Processing: The program compares characters using loops or recursion.

Output: It displays whether the input is a palindrome.
